x = done, / = half done, ! = needs testing

[ ] homepage: move aside up in mobile view
[ ] reloading when kyoku has ended goes to lobby; should send the roundstate then too
[ ] setup sending email: support and auth-account
[ ] https
[ ] make final points visible in elm
[ ] go through the TODO's in the code. If a note is relevant create an issue for it in gh and annotate the todo with issue number
[ ] Rework lobby: better listing of user names perhaps with facebook profile pics / gravatars
[ ] Set up logging from workers to a file.
[ ] refactoring: split H.Server to H.{Server.State,Server.Internal,Database,Database.Query} modules
[ ] refactoring: replace the StateT in kyoku code with a custom mechanism, which updates the kyoku state right after an event is triggered
[ ] make csrf middleware work with LogoutR too, so it can be enabled
[ ] after a game has ended, make it possible to go back to lobby.

# mechanics
[x] add test: riichi score is transferred on ron
[x] add test: honba are added to payments
[x] add test: riichi points on table are transferred on win

[x] add test: ankan in riichi
[x] add test: dora and ura-dora counted on win
[x] add test: dora is flipped on kantsu meld
[x] add test: cannot win with a hand without yaku. Not even if there are dora or ura-dora.

[x] add test: suucha riichi: four players riichi. last discard may be called ron on
[x] add test: suukaikan: four kantsu called, all not by one player.
[x] Implement the suukantsu yaku. Add tests. When one player calls the fourth, game must not end.
[x] add test: 13 orphans can be ron from an ankan
[x] implement: A player is not considered tenpai if he is waiting only for a tile of which he already has 4
[x] add test: kazoe yakuman
[x] add test: double ron
[x] add tests for the yakumans
[x] implement aka-dora
[x] add test: aka-dora are yielded as extrayaku
[x] add test: when a ron/chankan shout isn't possible due to furiten/0 yaku or otherwise, someone can still go for a kan/pon/chi on the tile. (The invalid ron should not be present in the kyoku state machine in the first place.)
[x] Show-instance for tiles: add ""; also Read
[x] add test: aka-dora are calculated from a called mentsu
[x] add test: kokushi furiten
[x] add test: chiitoi furiten
[x] shouting a aka-dora results in all tiles of the mentsu be aka-dora
# client
[x] sending messages
[x] interface for viewing different kyoku states
[x] Highlight corresponding tiles on shout hovers
[x] Display hands of tenpai players on ryuukyoku
[x] when a call is passed, update callable info to client. client should not show it
[x] Display winning hand
[x] agari-call deserialization has changed (agarichankan removed)
[x] Display concealed hands of other players
[x] display aka-dora as red
# site
[x] In the settings page, encourage making feature requests via the support form
[x] Rework authentication system. *Email-based*. Include facebook etc. and gravatar.
[x] test facebook authentication
[x] report bug button: game UUID
[x] The yesod binary doesn't reconnect to hajong-server automatically. Make it shut down on disconnect.


# someday/maybe
[ ] add tests: riichi-transfers on multi-ron
[ ] Save game results to relational database
[ ] inspect test failure:
      TileGroupings of tiles of 'tileGroup' .<-- [ tileGroup ]:                    FAIL (0.34s)
              *** Gave up! Passed only 98 tests.
[ ] refactor the kyoku code: make it possible to only modify the state via events; the event should take effect in the StateT data immediately after 'telling' it
[ ] add test: kuushuu kyuuhai: 9 different honors or terminals on initial draw
[ ] when discarding "valid" shout options for furiten/no yaku, instead of discarding add them to a not-allowed record and if someone attempts to call them, emit corresponding error message. This eases debugging in the future.
