## open tasks
[ ] [game/gameserver] separation of concerns: redesign kyoku into a state machine that starts with dealt tiles and ends with kyokuresults; Round so that it starts with game start and ends with finalpoints. so two different machines on two abstraction levels
[ ] [game] in calculating the shape and value of hand, should separete between (4+pair) and others. would simplify many parts of the code
[ ] [game] make local acid state directory configurable (mainly for tests)
[ ] [elm/game] display uradora on win. They're in roundstate .flags when someone has won (or at least, should be)
[ ] [elm/game] new dora are not updated from server? at least, not displayed in elm without a refresh. see the flipped-dora event.
[ ] [elm] when over 3 * 6 tiles, the +1th goes to fourth row; should extend the 3rd
[ ] [elm] on tsumo, agari is not displayed at all. it is in hand-picks and those are not displayed atm
[ ] [elm] add clickables via elm-html. That is, tiles in hand and shouts. The Graphics.Input.clickable has major problems with at least android tablets
[ ] [elm] restyle kyoku results and final points views. they're crappy at best.  Perhaps should fit into the info block in the center? and the winning hand(s) could be displayed as the hand of the winning player(s).
[!] [elm] should discard the hovered/shout-indicator hovers after they're no longer relevant (bugs at leat mobile devices). Would discarding them after turn changes be enough?
[ ] [elm] after a game has ended (final points shown), make it possible to go back to lobby.
[ ] [gameserver] reloading when kyoku has ended and is in waiting state, goes to lobby; (because there is no kyokustate?). Should have a separete "waiting"-screen to be shown when kyoku is in any of the waiting states.
[ ] [site/gameserver] https
[ ] [site] add favicon
[ ] [other] go through the TODO's in the code. If a note is relevant create an issue for it in gh and annotate the todo with issue number

# someday/maybe
[ ] refactoring: replace the StateT in kyoku code with a custom mechanism, which updates the kyoku state right after an event is triggered
[ ] add tests: riichi-transfers on multi-ron
[ ] make csrf middleware work with LogoutR too, so it can be enabled
[ ] Save game results to relational database
[ ] inspect test failure:
      TileGroupings of tiles of 'tileGroup' .<-- [ tileGroup ]:                    FAIL (0.34s)
              *** Gave up! Passed only 98 tests.
[ ] refactor the kyoku code: make it possible to only modify the state via events; the event should take effect in the StateT data immediately after 'telling' it
[ ] add test: kuushuu kyuuhai: 9 different honors or terminals on initial draw
[ ] when discarding "valid" shout options for furiten/no yaku, instead of discarding add them to a not-allowed record and if someone attempts to call them, emit corresponding error message. This eases debugging in the future. 
[ ] (graphics) point sticks (1000 done)
[ ] (graphics) more esthetic tiles
[ ] (elm) chat/dialog
